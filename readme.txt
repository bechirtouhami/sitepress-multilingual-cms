Turns any WordPress site into a fully featured multilingual content management system (CMS).

== Description ==

WPML makes it easy to build full multilingual websites with WordPress.
It integrates multilingual content management with robust navigation.

*Features*

 * **Multilingual content** support that allows selecting post/page languages and creating translations.
 * **CMS navigation** elements including drop down menus, breadcrumbs trail and sidebar navigation.
 * **Integrated content translation** makes it possible to run multilingual sites on tiny budgets and with no effort.
 * Robust links to posts and pages that never break.

*Highlights*

* When running a multilingual site, each page, post, tag or category has its own language. Translations for the same contents are grouped together, but not mixed in the database.
* CMS navigation elements work together to provide accurate and easy to use site-wide navigation.
* All drop down menus are implemented with pure CSS, are 100% HTML valid and support IE6, IE7, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and any other browser we tested on.
* Extra simple CSS for easy customization.

= Multilingual content support =

One WordPress site will be able to run multiple languages. The plugin allows selecting which languages to include and how to arrange them (in language folders or independent domains).

To configure languages, go to WPML->Languages. Select which languages to include and the default site language (which is also the admin language).
The plugin will set the WP_LANG variable, so that the correct .mo files are loaded and the content language is set by WordPress.

Each page, post, tag or category will have a new section for translations. This section allows switching from one language to the other and adding translations to existing contents.

See more info in the [language setup howto](http://wpml.org/home/getting-started-guide/language-setup/) page.

= Content Translation =

This service is intended for people who don't want to translate the contents of their WordPress sites themselves.

**WPML's tranlsation interface can send all contents that need to be translated to professional (human) translators**. It's a paid service.

Because this translation service is highly integrated with the multilingual content management functions, it's completely effortless to use. Just one click and everything is sent to translation.
Translated contents are returned directly to WordPress and can be published immediately or stay held for review.

You can learn more about WPML's content translation in the [content translation guide](http://wpml.org/wordpress-translation/content-translation/).

**The translation service is an optional feature of the plugin**. People who need it can use it, others can translate themselves with ease.

= CMS navigation =

WPML makes it easy to add CMS navigation to your website. It will let you create:

* Top navigation with drop down menus.
* Breadcrumbs trail showing how to get from each page to the home page (and all pages in between).
* Sidebar navigation that shows pages next to the current one, arranged by their page hierarchy.

The sidebar element is widget ready. You can include it in the theme or drop as a widget. The top-navigation and breadcrumbs trail should be included in the theme.

For integration instruction in the theme, visit the [navigation usage](http://wpml.org/home/getting-started-guide/site-navigation/) page.

To style the drop down menu, you can use the [Drop down menu customization tool](http://wpml.org/support/drop-down-menu-customization/).

= Sticky links =

WPML can turn ordinary internal links into unbreakable sticky links. Sticky links track the URL of the page and update when the target page updates.

If you're linking to *example.com/about_us* and that page changes to *example.com/we_sell/company*, all Sticky links to that page will update immediately.

Learn more about it in the [Sticky links usage](http://wpml.org/home/getting-started-guide/sticky-links/) page.

= Template integration = 

Besides the hooks for adding the navigation elements the plugin defines the following constants which you can use in your template:

* `ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE` - the current language code (e.g. fr).
* `ICL_LANGUAGE_NAME` - the current language name in the current language (e.g. Fran√ßais).
* `ICL_LANGUAGE_NAME_EN` - the current language name in English (e.g. French).

These constants can be used to create language dependent design for your site.

== Installation ==

1. Place the folder containing this file into the plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin from the admin interface

WPML needs to create tables in your database. These tables are used to hold the new language information. In order to use WPML, your MySQL user needs to have sufficient privileges to create new tables in the database.
